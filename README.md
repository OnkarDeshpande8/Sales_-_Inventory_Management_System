# Sales & Inventory ManagementSystem
Sales &amp; Inventory Management System using Python for  Morya Sales And Servises.

Tools – Python-Tkinter,Google Sheet, MS Excel.



#	INTRODUCTION
This Software is specially made for Morya Sales & Services, Hupari for inventory and sales management. Using this software, we can manage inventory or stock of tyres and tubes. We provide inbuilt billing system so we can generate invoice and all sales data saved in excel sheet.
We use python language for development of this software. Because python provide ready to go libraries like tkinter for GUI development and also, we can work with excel sheets easily using python library pandas. 

#	SOFTWARE TOOLS

•	Python Programming

Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.
This specially designed Python tutorial will help you learn Python Programming Language in most efficient way, with the topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Deep-Learning, etc.) with examples.
Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:

1.	Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.
2.	Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.
3.	Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java.
Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.
4.	Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.
5.	The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following:
•	Machine Learning
•	GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )
•	Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)
•	Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)
•	Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
•	Test frameworks
•	Multimedia
•	Python Libraries

A.	Tkinter

Tkinter is a standard library Python that used for GUI application. Tkinter with Python offers a straightforward and fast way to create GUI applications. Tk GUI works on the object-oriented approach which makes it a powerful library. Tkinter is widely available for all operating systems. It is pre-install in the Python. To work with the Tkinter, we must install the Python. In this tutorial, we will learn to install Tkinter.
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −
•	Import the Tkinter module.
•	Create the GUI application main window.
•	Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.
•	Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

B.	Pandas

The Pandas library is one of the most important and popular tools for Python data scientists and analysts, as it is the backbone of many data projects. Pandas is an open-source Python package for data cleaning and data manipulation. It provides extended, flexible data structures to hold different types of labeled and relational data. On top of that, it is actually quite easy to install and use.
Pandas is often used in conjunction with other Python libraries. In fact, Pandas is built on the NumPy package, so a lot of the structure between them is similar. Pandas is also used in SciPy for statistical analysis or with Matplotlib for plotting functions. Pandas can be used on its own with a text editor or with Juptyer Notebooks, the ideal environment for more complex data modeling. Pandas is available for most versions of Python, including Python3.
Think of Pandas as the home for your data where you can clean, analyze, and transform your data, all in one place. Pandas is essentially a more powerful replacement for Excel. Using Pandas, you can do things like:
•	Easily calculate statistics about data such as finding the average, distribution, and median of columns
•	Use data visualization tools, such as Matplotlib, to easily create plot bars, histograms, and more
•	Clean your data by filtering columns by particular criteria or easily removing values
•	Manipulate your data flexibly using operations like merging, joining, reshaping, and more
•	Read, write, and store your clean data as a database, txt file, or CSV file




C.	Pyinstaller

PyInstaller is a package in Python which bundles all the dependencies of Python applications in a single package. We don’t need to install different packages or modules for different applications. PyInstaller reads and analyses our code and then discovers the modules that our program requires in order to execute. It then packages them into a single folder or a single executable file. It is used of create .exe files for windows, .app files for Mac and distributable packages for Linux.
We can download PyInstaller from PyPI. We can install it using pip package manager. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install PyInstaller there.
Enter the following command in windows command prompt- pip install pyinstaller
